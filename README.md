# Data Compression Primitives

This is an attempt to start mapping out the various data structures
and algorithms in Data Compression - what would be absolutely
right to have - for people to start using and writing out
their large data systems with the right primitives.

## Project Philosophy

Why isn't all the great data compression code in ONE usable library? DCP aims to provide a comprehensive, language-agnostic set of primitives so that anyone can build robust, efficient data systems from the ground up. We value readable and modifiable code over raw speedâ€”making it easy for others to learn from, use, and extend.

## Call for Volunteers

We request volunteers to implement the remaining primitives in this Java library. If you are interested in implementing these primitives in another language, fork the main [DataCompressionPrimitives repository](https://github.com/DataCompressionPrimitives/DataCompressionPrimitives), create your language-specific implementation, and link it back in a pull request. 

## List of Implementations

See [LANGUAGES.md](LANGUAGES.md) and [IMPLEMENTATIONS.md](IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) for a detailed, up-to-date status of implemented Data Compression Primitives. Fork this repository and send a pull request to add your implementation.
